"zenpark unveils its plan to become the leading European smart car park operator for the smart city
Paris, January 29, 2019 - zenpark, Europe's leading connected shared car park operator and number one French car park provider for the smart city, announces a fundraising of more than 10 million euros. this fundraising marks the arrival of two new investors, the edf group and the ratp group, alongside the historic investors demeter, maif future, nestadio capital and a-venture which reinforce the capital.
On this occasion, william rosenfeld, CEO and co-founder of zenpark, outlines zenpark's two strategic priorities:
• consolidation of the leading position of the connected shared car park
• accelerated growth of the ""smart parking"" business
zenpark transforms the basement of cities into shared, connected and service parkings
with one in four motorists in search of a parking space in major European cities, motorists see parking spaces for private vehicles reduce significantly. However, this urban mobility policy is the only one that is valid in the long term to reduce the negative externalities linked to the automobile and thus make the city softer to live for all.
that's why zenpark's mission is to design and operate Europe's largest network of connected serviced shared car parks in order to provide motorists and city stakeholders with an immediate, efficient and sustainable solution that meets the challenges of urban parking.
consolidation of the leading position of the connected shared car park
thanks to its patented technology, zenpark operates a shared car park service for motorists and motorcyclists who wish to park a few hours, a few days, a few weeks or rent a place in the month, at a competitive price and in a simple way. zenpark connects all underutilized private car parks, such as hotels, social landlords, student / senior residences, and others, and shares them with other users via its mobile application. this new fundraising will enable the company to extend its network of shared car parks connected in france and belgium, develop new offers for parking partners and further improve the user experience already acclaimed by its customers . other European countries are already identified and will be launched according to market opportunities.
accelerated growth of the ""smart parking"" business
the design of the smart city imagined by communities, planners, and real estate developers, now requires ""smart parking"", ie smart and connected car parks that are natively integrated into the infrastructure of buildings and pool the infrastructure. space in the basement to respond dynamically. the uses of all users: owners, tenants, employees and visitors to the general public. Capitalizing on its technological expertise and operator know-how, zenpark has built a radically innovative solution for smart parking which reduces the number of places to be built in urban development projects while ensuring that all users have a good time. higher level of service. with nearly 350 smart parking projects, zenpark immediately became the number one French operator
shared parking for the smart city. this fundraising will enable zenpark to accelerate its growth in this sector and launch new innovative services starting in 2019, particularly for businesses and real estate companies. the smart parking market is booming with more than 20% annual growth in europe, zenpark also intends to deploy its offer beyond France."
"After a meeting on January 24th, EDF and the Ministry of Ecological and Solidarity transition validated a work program prior to a decision on the ecocombust project.
this work program is expected to qualify, by the fall of 2019, the technical tests, the environmental impact studies and the economic model of the project. at that date, subject to satisfactory technical, economic and environmental conclusions, and after continuing the exchanges with the State and local authorities, EDF will begin the industrialization phase for the manufacture of the fuel from 2022.
the ecocombust project is in line with the climate plan of july 2017, the national low carbon strategy (snbc) and the multiannual energy program (ppe) of November 2018, which provide for the cessation of production coal-based electricity by 2022 and the development of biomass resources. ecocombust is the result of work begun in 2015 by EDF teams to study the development of a new type of biomass fuel initially intended to supply its coal-fired power plants.
The ecocombust project consists of manufacturing an innovative and environmentally friendly fuel for the operation of heating or electricity production facilities currently using coal. fuel fabrication would be done on site and would launch a new sector to recover wood waste that is not used today and are most often buried or landfilled.
as part of the securing of electricity supply in the north-west quarter, in particular in Brittany, and if the government studies requested by the government confirmed the need, if necessary until 2026, some or all all of the biomass manufactured could be used to supply 80% of the current units to meet the needs of securing the electricity grid in the west of France during the peak hours of consumption. in this scenario, given both the strong substitution of coal and the limited annual operating hours, annual CO2 emissions would be about 25 times lower than the current situation.
jean-bernard lévy, president and CEO of edf, said: ""edf is delighted with this progress. our teams remain fully mobilized to meet the demands of the state to qualify ecocombust, a new type of innovative and environmentally friendly fuel. The validation of the ecocombust work program enables EDF to pursue its mission and is fully in keeping with the framework laid down by multiannual energy programming. """

"Sixteen of the largest European companies join forces to promote the development of sustainable finance
January 15, 2019 - a year after the green bond pledge in paris, which marked the 2017 edition of the climate finance day, sixteen European companies (edf, edp, enel, engie, ferrovie dello stato italian, iberdrola, icade, ørsted, ratp, sncf network, big Paris company, sse, tennet, terna, tideway, vasakronan) are joining forces to create the corporate forum on sustainable finance (""the forum""). the forum aims to create a permanent network of exchange of opinions and ideas. it brings together green bond issuers who are committed to defending and developing sustainable finance that effectively combats climate change and promotes a sustainable and responsible society.
the objective of the founding members of the forum, from different economic sectors such as electricity generation, clean transport infrastructure and activities, environmental infrastructure and services, as well as real estate, is to actively contribute to the development of financial instruments in line with sustainable finance. These tools, which include so-called ""green"" and ""sustainable"" bonds and loans, credit facilities and other sustainable financing tools, put their issuers in a sustainable business model.
the forum represents more than two-thirds of green and sustainable bond volumes from European companies. he believes that sustainable financing tools are effective market instruments for allocating economic resources where they are most needed. this includes giving priority to low carbon and sustainable investments which are at the heart of the corporate strategies of the members of the forum.
today, we are joining forces to strengthen our commitments made in 2017, with the aim of:
to further integrate the notion of sustainability into the financial strategies of our respective companies,
work with investors to foster the development of a sustainable economy through innovative financing tools,
increase the participation of companies in national and international forums that guide the development of sustainable financial markets,
actively participate in the development of standards and regulatory frameworks for sustainable financial instruments,
use our expertise and promote best practices in terms of reporting on the impact of the strategies implemented,
interact with rating agencies to better integrate ISR criteria when assessing the long-term financial strength of companies.
Sustainable finance is a formidable challenge for both issuing companies and investors. it will become more and more important as investors adapt quickly to these new trends and will be more and more inclined to invest in sustainable initiatives.
As a result, the forum represents an opportunity for its stakeholders to be at the forefront of the transition to a sustainable low-carbon model."
"On Friday, December 14, 2018 CNG and EDF announced, at a joint press conference in Beijing, that the No. 1 unit of the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant had become the first epr in the world to enter commercial operation. this final milestone was reached on Thursday, December 13, 2018 at the end of the final regulatory test of continuous operation and at full power for 168 hours. the success of this step marks the achievement of all the conditions necessary for the safe operation of the reactor.
the taishan nuclear power plant, consisting of two epr reactors of 1750 mw each, is the largest Sino-French cooperation project in the energy sector. the taishan power plant with these two reactors will be able to supply the Chinese power grid with up to 24 TWh of co2-free electricity a year, equivalent to the annual consumption of 5 million Chinese, while avoiding the emission of approximately 21 million tonnes of CO2 per year.
the taishan nuclear power plant project is run by tnpjvc, a joint venture founded by cgn (51%), edf (30%) and the yuedian provincial Chinese electrician (19%). the edf group with its framatome subsidiary has acted as a supplier of third generation epr technology, which meets the highest international safety standards. edf also brought the feedback from the flamanville 3 epr, which was taken into account as a key factor in the success of taishan 1 in the early phases of the project. cgn managed the site by capitalizing on its experience of more than 30 years in the construction of nuclear power plants.
taishan 1 benefited from 35 years of strategic cooperation between edf and cgn, engaged in the construction of the first Chinese nuclear power station at daya bay. the two companies also relied on the complementarity of the French and Chinese nuclear sectors, thus promoting their rise in skills and offering them new opportunities.
taishan 1 brings its experience in project management and technology management to epr reactors around the world. the first to benefit from it are the two Hinkley Point C reactors currently under construction in the UK. the two companies are also partners in two other British projects: the 2 epr sizewellc project and the bradwell b project, which is based on hualong technology.
he yu, chairman of the china general nuclear power group, said: ""The entry into operation of taishan 1 marks the culmination of a strategic project supported by the French and Chinese heads of state. As the first epr in the world, Taishan 1 will bring an important stone to the construction of reactors of the same type in the world and will serve as a model for the common project of Hinkley Point C in Great Britain carried by Cgn and EDF. ""
jean-bernard lévy, edf's president and chief executive officer, said: ""The commercial commissioning of taishan 1, the world's first epr, is a success for the entire French nuclear industry. it demonstrates the capacity of the sector to design a third generation reactor in compliance with the highest standards of safety and quality. epr is an important asset to the challenge that many countries face: responding to the growing demand for electricity while reducing their CO2 emissions. the taishan project also illustrates our approach to developing nuclear projects around the world, based on partnerships with trusted players such as cgn.

"An actor involved in sport for more than 25 years and a major partner of the French Football Federation (FFF) since 2014, EDF is strengthening its support for women's football by becoming a national supporter of the 8th FIFA Women's World Cup 2019 in France.

edf becomes the fifth national supporter of the competition, which will take place from June 7 to July 7, 2019. This event promises to be a great celebration of football and a showcase of the progress made by women's sport. As a national supporter, edf will be able to display its brand before and during the competition, to benefit from ticketing and hospitality formulas, and to use certain brands and the audiovisual content of the fifatm.

edf has been particularly involved over the past four years in promoting women's football, through dedicated activations, but also with the involvement of laura georges in the edf team. at the last fifatm women's world cup, played in canada in 2015, a web series was created with alain bernard to support the blue before the competition. on the occasion of the 2016 Olympic Games, a social media campaign was organized. Finally, during the euro 2017, a new web series, featuring the u13 women's section of the Guyancourt, had been broadcast on social networks ""enlighten football"".

julien villeret, communication director of the edf group, said: ""We are very proud to be one of the national supporters of the fifatm for this event and thus contribute to the promotion of women's football. this partnership is a continuation of our commitment to football and reflects the values ​​dear to the edf group of team spirit, inclusion and diversity. this competition will bring together those who are passionate about football. for edf, supporting a sporting event of this magnitude is a great opportunity. ""

philippe floc'h, fifa sales director, said, ""we are pleased to announce another important signature for the FIFA Women's World Cup. the impressive list of our national supporters clearly confirms the growing interest in women's football. in the wake of the strategy for women's football that we have just launched, fifa strives to strengthen the visibility of women's football and develop its commercial potential. being able to collaborate with leading companies such as EDF will certainly help us achieve these goals. ""

Noël le graët, president of the local organizing committee (col) and the French Football Federation (fff), said: ""partner of the french football federation for many years, edf joined us today to support the organization of the women's world cup of fifa, france 2019. this is excellent news, especially to a few days of the draw. We welcome EDF as the fifth national supporter. the famous French group reinforces its commitment to women's football through its participation in this great competition. """
"Because the future is carbon-free in homes heated with fossil fuels, EDF is launching an exceptional ""boost"" bonus to help French households replace their oil-fired boilers with a heat pump1. edf will abound by 50% the bonus ""boost saving energy"" set up by the government for households who choose a heat pump. the total aid thus paid by edf will amount to € 4,500 for the most modest households2 and € 3,000 for other households.
to go further in supporting household purchasing power, cham, a subsidiary of edf, will offer a 15% offer on the first year of the heat pump maintenance contract3.
More than 3 million households are still heated by fuel in France, including 1 million modest households who are often forced to restrict their use of heating. oil heating emits 6 tons of CO2 per unit per year and today represents an annual bill of more than € 1,900 on average, the evolution of which is subject to fluctuations in the price of oil4.
Heat pumps capture renewable and free energy in the air or the ground and restore the home to up to four times more energy than that consumed. their carbon footprint is advantageous, with up to 90% less CO2 emissions compared to fuel oil. and thanks to their high energy efficiency, heat pumps can reduce the heating bill from 800 to 1,000 € per year compared to an oil-fired boiler5.
the ""boost"" premium, in addition to certain existing state aid schemes6, contributes to significantly reducing the cost of purchasing and installing a heat pump for households.
to benefit from it, it will be enough to register on the site premium-energie-edf.fr before signing its quotation of works and to create its work file by gathering the justifying documents as explained on the site.
thanks to the edf & moi mobile application, edf customers benefit from edf's support to help them monitor, understand and control their energy consumption.
edf is part of the government's goal of replacing 300,000 oil boilers a year by 2027. In this context, electricity has a major role to play. the electricity produced in france by edf is a very low-carbon energy source thanks to nuclear energy and renewable energies, which makes it a major lever in the fight against global warming.

"Sunday, December 2, the EDF Group launches its new communication strategy driven by a multichannel campaign. the climate emergency is now recognized by a majority of French people who are numerous to mobilize and wish to act on their scale1. the success of the energy transition requires the involvement of all. edf, already a leader in low carbon electricity generation2, is committed to going even further by supporting French consumers with concrete solutions that make it possible for everyone to make a difference.
in keeping with the group's strategy, cap 2030, the new campaign highlights five major themes that illustrate edf's beliefs about what tomorrow's energy will be like the actions already undertaken by edf to achieve it.
even lower carbon energy: the edf group is committed to reducing its CO2 emissions by 40% by 2030.
greener energy: edf aims to double the share of renewable energies in its energy mix by 20303 and offers green electricity and sustainable gas offers.
a better controlled energy: edf allows all its customers to precisely track their consumption and receive personalized advice to save energy.
a more local energy: EDF gives the means to its private customers, businesses and communities to produce and consume their own energy.
energy for more sustainable mobility: edf has launched the electric mobility plan to enable four times more vehicles to run on electricity in europe within four years.

""Become the energy that changes everything""
From May 68 to fighting for women's rights until the great awareness of the climate issue today, the film pays tribute to the great collective movements. in the face of the climate emergency, edf proposes an optimistic vision based on future solutions such as electric mobility, self-consumption or the steering of energy consumption, which the group is committed today to making accessible to the greatest number.
Directed and orchestrated by havas / betc, the campaign is deployed in tv, cinema, digital as well as in press and display. the public is invited to visit edf.fr to find out more about the group's solutions. the campaign runs from December 2 to 22, 2018.

"since 2004, edf was involved in a labeling process through the social responsibility label, which is now owned by the national institute of customer relations. however, the new version of this label, which came into effect in 2018, greatly reduces the importance of the location criteria in France or abroad for call centers.
edf has always been committed to recognizing and promoting customer relationship jobs based in france. the company therefore considers that the new label no longer meets its requirements for corporate social responsibility.
all edf customer service centers are located in france. this represents more than 5,000 client advisors, employees and service providers, serving all of its individual, professional, industrial and community customers. they help maintain job pools throughout the territory. edf is committed to promoting the choice of this social model. a choice shared by the French since 94% of them consider that a customer service based in France is important1.

as part of this contract and in parallel with the launch of a car-sharing label, 280 terminals of the autobleue2 network will be modernized with new-generation plugs allowing all types of electric vehicles to be recharged. 73 additional kiosks will also be installed, which will bring the entire network to 500 charging points in total and will provide a complete network of the 49 municipalities of the city. by the end of 2019, the number of fast-charging stations will be multiplied by three, 20 semi-fast charging stations will be installed and 15 new kiosks will be installed in the relay car parks near the tram stations.
the recharging offer, which goes from normal charging to fast charging, will meet all the uses and needs of electric vehicle drivers. the terminals will be accessible with the nice metropolis pass or in interoperability with the izivia3 pass.
the implementation of this contract will be carried out by izivia and citelum, two subsidiaries of the edf group respectively specialists in electric mobility and energy services for the city. as part of this contract, izivia will be responsible for the supervision and technical operation of the network, the implementation of the charging service to users via the creation of a web platform and a mobile app as well as the relationship to users (customer service, hotline and troubleshooting). Citelum will be in charge of the monitoring and maintenance of the charging stations as well as the deployment of the 73 additional terminals of the existing network.
christian estrosi, president of the metropolis nice côte d'azur said: ""by the elaboration of our second climate plan, currently underway, I engaged the Nice metropolis of the French Riviera in an ambitious process of energy transition and reducing our carbon footprint. I intend to make every effort, by establishing a more balanced energy mix in particular, to encourage our citizens to adopt a sustainable and cleaner mobility and to invite them to consider other modes of travel.
I am pleased with this partnership with edf, the flagship group of our French industry, which will enable us to accelerate the deployment of electric vehicles in our region in the coming weeks. ""
jean-bernard lévy, chairman and CEO of the edf group said: ""the edf group is happy to accompany the nice french Riviera metropolis in its goal to accelerate the development of electric mobility on its territory. reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector is a major challenge in the fight against global warming and for the preservation of the air quality of our cities. with the electric mobility plan, edf is aiming for the deployment of 75,000 terminals and the low-carbon electricity supply of 600,000 electric vehicles in France and its three largest European markets by 2022, thus creating the conditions for a clean mobility, everywhere and for all.

"edf welcomes the decisions taken by the government to encourage households to replace their oil boilers with conversion bonuses. this is an opportunity for them to think of equipping themselves with modern heating means that are both more efficient, less expensive and more comfortable, ie low-carbon electrical equipment such as heat pumps.
Heat pumps capture renewable and free energy from the air or the ground and give the home up to four times more energy than it consumes. their carbon footprint is extremely advantageous: up to 90% less CO2 emissions compared to fuel oil and around 75-85% less compared to gas and lpg. Finally, thanks to their high energy efficiency, heat pumps can reduce the energy bill: about 60% compared to fuel oil and about 40% compared to gas or lpg.
there are already financial support schemes1 enabling households to significantly reduce the cost of installing a heat pump. to go further, as of 2017, edf has set up its energy premium which can represent up to a few thousand euros for energy renovation works, in particular the replacement of boilers. For more peace of mind, edf also proposes to connect its customers with qualified craftsmen through its network solutions solutions habitat. edf also offers tools to assist in the preparation of works such as an online simulator for energy saving.
for edf, the future is electricity in housing. Today, it enables the development of high-performance equipment that provides consumers with greater comfort through the control of equipment and facilitates energy savings. produced in France by edf thanks to nuclear energy and renewable energies, it is also a source of energy with a very low CO2 emissions, which makes it a major lever in the fight against global warming.
